# Low-Rank Matrix Completion with Block Coordinate Descent Methods

This repository contains the implementation used in our research article on low-rank matrix completion using various Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) techniques. It includes the main algorithms, an example usage script, and sample datasets.

## Contents

- `Hadamard_BCD.py` — Implementation of BCD algorithms (Lipschitz step size, optimal step size, exact minimization).
- `Hadamard_BCD_multiple.py` — Implementation for the multi factord version.
- `main.py` — Example usage script to run and compare the methods on sample datasets.
- `datasets/` — Directory containing test matrices (e.g., real-world datasets such as images or spectrometer data).
